# ðŸ¦† Parin

A delightfully simple 2D game engine for the [D programming language](https://dlang.org/).
Parin is designed to make game development fun â€” it's easy to set up and lets you jump right into making things.

## Hello World Example

```d
import parin;

// Called once when the game starts.
void ready() {
    lockResolution(320, 180);
}

// Called every frame while the game is running.
// If true is returned, then the game will stop running.
bool update(float dt) {
    drawDebugText("Hello world!", Vec2(8));
    return false;
}

// Called once when the game ends.
void finish() {}

// Creates a main function that calls the given functions.
mixin runGame!(ready, update, finish);
```

## Quick Start

This guide shows how to install Parin using [DUB](https://dub.pm/).
Create a new folder and run inside the following commands:

```sh
dub init -n
dub run parin:setup
dub run
```

If everything is set up correctly, a window will appear showing the message "Hello world!".

### Required Libraries on Linux

Some libraries for sound, graphics, and input handling are required before using Parin on Linux. Below are installation commands for some Linux distributions.

**Ubuntu**:

```sh
sudo apt install libasound2-dev libx11-dev libxrandr-dev libxi-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxcursor-dev libxinerama-dev libwayland-dev libxkbcommon-dev
```

**Fedora**:

```sh
sudo dnf install alsa-lib-devel mesa-libGL-devel libX11-devel libXrandr-devel libXi-devel libXcursor-devel libXinerama-devel libatomic
```

**Arch**:

```sh
sudo pacman -S alsa-lib mesa libx11 libxrandr libxi libxcursor libxinerama
```

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How can I build without DUB?

> [!NOTE]
> Equivalent scripts for these steps are available in the scripts folder.
> Run `scripts/prepare` or `scripts\prepare.bat` to prepare the project.
> Run `scripts/run` or `scripts\run.bat` to compile and run it.

Create a new folder and run inside the following commands:

**Prepare folder**:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Kapendev/parin parin_package
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/Kapendev/joka joka_package
cp -r parin_package/source/parin .
cp -r joka_package/source/joka .
cp parin_package/examples/basics/_001_hello.d app.d
# On Windows: cp parin_package/vendor/windows_x86_64/*.dll .
```

**Compile & run**:

```sh
# Use `windows_x86_64` or another folder for a different platform.
ldc2 -L=-Lparin_package/vendor/linux_x86_64 -J=parin -i -run app.d
# Or: opend -L=-Lparin_package/vendor/linux_x86_64 -run app.d
```

### How do I make a web build?

> [!NOTE]
> Equivalent scripts for these steps are available in the scripts folder.
> Run `scripts/web` or `scripts\web.bat` to create a web build.

Parin includes a build script for the web in the [packages](packages/) folder. Building for the web also requires [Emscripten](https://emscripten.org/).

**Running the script with DUB**:

```sh
dub run parin:web
```

**Without DUB**:

```sh
ldc2 -J=parin_package/packages/web/source -run parin_package/packages/web/source/app.d
# Or: opend -run parin_package/packages/web/source/app.d
```

Below are installation commands for Emscripten for some Linux distributions.

**Ubuntu**:

```sh
sudo apt install emscripten
```

**Fedora**:

```sh
sudo dnf install emscripten
```

**Arch**:

```sh
yay -S emscripten
# Or: sudo pacman -S emscripten
```

### Is Parin a raylib wrapper?

No. Raylib is just the current backend.
A custom backend may be added in the future, but it's not a priority.

### What are Parin's priorities?

The goal is a smooth experience, similar to Godot or Unity.

### Where does `Vec2` come from?

`Vec2` is a type provided by the [Joka](https://github.com/Kapendev/joka) library, which Parin depends on.

### How can I load an asset outside of the assets folder?

Call `setIsUsingAssetsPath(false)` to disable the default behavior.

### How can I hot reload assets?

Asset hot reloading is not supported out of the box.
The [arsd](https://github.com/adamdruppe/arsd) libraries may help.

### Are the Parin assets free to use?

Yes. Be sure to check the associated [README](assets/README.md) for any licensing notes.
